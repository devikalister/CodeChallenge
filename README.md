This repository contains a code challenge which is used to sort the given array as first odd numbers and then even numbers and find the unique 
permutations for the given array with JUNIT test cases

#Compile and run the application
https://github.com/devikalister/CodeChallenge/blob/master/src/main/java/com/app/codechallenge/main/CodeChallenge.java

Problem 1: 
To sort a list of numbers so that odd numbers are sorted before even numbers, and relative order is preserved.

#Run test case
https://github.com/devikalister/CodeChallenge/blob/master/src/test/java/com/test/codechallenge/SortingServiceTest.java

problem 2: 
To return all unique permutations of a list of numbers.

#Run test case
